# Changelog

All notable changes to The Rookery are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
at the repository level. One version describes the whole collection.

Because installs pull from `main`, this file is the "what changed since you last
looked" surface. GitHub Releases mirror its entries.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Added the public OSS foundation: documentation, an MIT license, community
  templates, private security reporting, and a maintainer release checklist.
- Added a shared Lefthook `pre-push` check group and a read-only GitHub Actions
  workflow with the required check name `Tests Status`.
- Added repository and workflow banners with optimized GitHub display assets.
- Added `managing-issues` for GitHub and Linear issue relationships, readiness,
  approved updates, and evidence-based completion checks.
- Added `repo-gardener` for scheduled repository-health reviews that may carry
  one bounded improvement to an unmerged pull request.
- Added `storm-research` for source-backed research through independent
  practitioner, academic, skeptic, economist, and historian perspectives.
- Added `checking-merge-readiness` for a read-only whole-change review and a
  merge, debug, or do-not-merge recommendation.
- Added `checking-pr-readiness` for comparing a finished branch with its plan,
  checking the evidence, and surfacing unresolved risks before a pull request.
- Added `creating-portable-skills` for creating, revising, testing, and
  verifying the installation of skills across supported agent tools.
- Added `personal-chief-of-staff` for daily wind-down, weekly, and quarterly
  reviews with source checks and approval before changes are written.
- Added `managing-personal-crm` for relationship context, conversation prep,
  follow-ups, and staged note cleanup without a separate CRM database.
- Added `reviewing-meetings` for turning completed meetings into grounded notes
  and independently approved follow-up actions.

### Changed

- Expanded `WORKFLOWS.md` into the seven-job playbook and made the README the
  single public catalog for individually installable skills.
- Standardized skill tests around trigger contracts, runnable behavioral cases,
  concise run logs, matched comparisons, and per-tool installation checks.
- Defined `main` as the rolling install source and semantic-version Release
  Snapshots as immutable historical checkpoints rather than install pins.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Repository scaffolding: community files, issue and pull-request templates,
  the skills catalog layout, and the seven-job workflow map.
- The first repository rules for a curated catalog, rolling `main`, and
  installation parity.
