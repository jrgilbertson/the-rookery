description: Use when the user wants to complete a daily journal or wind down, requests a daily chief-of-staff review or a weekly or quarterly review, asks to set up or repair chief-of-staff review sources, approves, resumes, or otherwise decides visible chief-of-staff actions, or another workflow requests current cross-source chief-of-staff context. Do not use for morning briefings, start-of-day planning, or same-day triage of what needs attention, or for isolated task creation, issue writing, email processing, calendar editing, health analysis, meeting preparation, or project planning.

# Personal Chief of Staff

Help the user review current evidence, correct their sources, and choose what
comes next. Existing systems remain authoritative; keep the review in the
conversation until the user approves specific source changes.

## Route the current message

Read [source-access.md](references/source-access.md) before the first source
access or write on every path. Load other resources only when the matched path
below names them. Resolve the message in this order:

1. **Visible review action decisions:** bind approvals, edits, deferrals, and
   skips to the exact displayed bundle and its originating mode. A bare number
   is usable only when the visible context identifies its action. Load that
   mode's reference and [action-application.md](references/action-application.md),
   plus [crm-companion.md](references/crm-companion.md) for a
   relationship-derived effect. Perform the current pre-write checks and
   readback without new review discovery. Load
   [source-bindings.md](references/source-bindings.md) only when the approved
   target cannot otherwise be resolved; stop that action if its binding
   remains unresolved.
2. **Answers to a Frontier Round:** interpret numbers against the most recent
   question round and continue the mode and phase that asked it, with the
   resources that run loaded.
3. **Source setup:** when asked to establish or repair review source ownership,
   or when replying to its binding preview,
   load [source-bindings.md](references/source-bindings.md) and resolve the
   requested roles with the user. This path opens no mode; finish it under
   [Finish standalone setup](references/source-bindings.md#finish-standalone-setup).
4. **A new review:** select one mode below. An explicit mode wins. Load
   [source-bindings.md](references/source-bindings.md) and resolve the private
   map before the mode's source retrieval. Before retrieval, also load
   [review-reasoning.md](references/review-reasoning.md), the mode reference,
   and [review-bundle.md](assets/review-bundle.md). Load
   [action-application.md](references/action-application.md) before proposing
   the first action, and [crm-companion.md](references/crm-companion.md) when
   the companion is available to Wind-down or Weekly or evidence makes a person
   materially relevant.
5. **Cross-source context for another workflow:** load
   [source-bindings.md](references/source-bindings.md) for only the roles that
   caller's decision needs. Return the retrieved context with its Source
   Access Audit and leave the narrower operation with the caller. This path
   opens no mode.

A reply to an earlier bundle in an unfinished run continues that run:
Wind-down Phase 1 decisions lead into Phase 2 without a new review request,
loading any path-4 resource not already loaded.

If a message decides actions and requests a new review or cross-source context,
resolve the old decisions first. Finish Phase 2 when the decisions belong to a
Wind-down Phase 1 bundle. Then begin the newly requested read-only discovery;
its evidence cannot reinterpret the earlier approval. Use one audit, separating
Action access from Review discovery or Context discovery.

| Mode | Request | Read before retrieval |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wind-down | Close the day, complete the daily journal, reflect, prepare tomorrow, or run a daily review, including a scheduled wind-down | [wind-down.md](references/wind-down.md) |
| Weekly | Complete or discuss a weekly review | [weekly.md](references/weekly.md) |
| Quarterly | Complete or discuss a quarterly review | [quarterly.md](references/quarterly.md) |

Generic daily review wording selects Wind-down. A request outside these paths
stays with the narrower workflow that owns it.

Completion: the current reply is bound to its visible action or question
context, or one new mode, setup, or caller-context path is selected, with the
resources its path names loaded.

## Review together

Follow the selected mode interactively. Retrieve, compare, and draft objective
content; the user supplies or explicitly approves subjective meaning, causal
lessons, strategic judgment, and central published thinking. Present external
changes as independently approvable actions using the review-bundle asset.

Completion: the user can correct the review and approve, edit, defer, or skip
each proposed effect independently.

## End explicitly

Use exactly one run ending. A standalone setup run conducts no review; judge
its ending by
[Finish standalone setup](references/source-bindings.md#finish-standalone-setup).

- **Complete:** the review and all approved actions finished.
- **Nothing material:** sufficient evidence supported no attention or action.
- **Partial:** a useful review finished with named material evidence limits.
- **Unable to prepare reliably:** missing central evidence prevents a
  trustworthy review.
- **Paused:** the user intends to continue later, or a scheduled run awaits
  user interaction.
- **Skipped:** the user chose not to conduct the review.

Close with what changed and every action still unapplied, across all bundles
in the run. Apply the shared
[resumption rules](references/source-access.md#end-and-resume-honestly) when
continuing later.

Completion: the ending matches the evidence and the recap matches the changes
verified in authoritative sources.
