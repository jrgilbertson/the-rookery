# Route Work

Read [references/routing.md](references/routing.md) through its
`route-work-contract-end` marker before assessing the request. It is the
single source of truth for every routing decision and output; do not recreate
its tables here.

## Assess, render, stop

1. Assess the request under the reference.
2. Render exactly one of its response templates without changing the heading
   or field labels.
3. Stop immediately after the card.
