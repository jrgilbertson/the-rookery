# Baseline test: creating-skills

Mode rule — pick the mode that matches the flow:

- **New skill:** run each prompt with and without the skill.
- **Revision:** run each prompt with the prior version and the revised version.

Run every prompt in a fresh agent context with the right variant loaded —
use the harness's native mechanism for a clean context (a subagent, a CLI
exec, a new session). Never compare inside one warm session; carried-over
context contaminates the baseline.

These cases are new-skill mode (with/without). A with-skill run passes when
it demonstrably enforces the four disciplines a bare prompt skips:

1. Portability gates applied — portable frontmatter only, capability-based prose, self-contained directory.
2. Instructions evidence-gated — the delete test runs; unearned lines get cut.
3. Description tested as a trigger contract — should-trigger and near-miss queries built and run.
4. The standard loop followed — interview through validation, baseline, review, and package, with completion criteria observed.

## Case 1: Create a commit-message skill from scratch

Date: [YYYY-MM-DD] | Harness: [name] | Model: [name]

| Prompt | Baseline behavior (observed) | With-skill behavior (observed) | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create a skill that makes agents write conventional commit messages for this repo, and get it ready to share | | | |

Expected delta: baseline typically writes a one-shot SKILL.md with no interview, no validation run, and an untested description; with-skill runs the loop and produces a validated, trigger-tested, portable package.

## Case 2: Review and fix an existing skill

Date: [YYYY-MM-DD] | Harness: [name] | Model: [name]

| Prompt | Baseline behavior (observed) | With-skill behavior (observed) | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Review this skill and fix anything wrong with it: [path to a small existing skill] | | | |

Expected delta: baseline edits ad hoc; with-skill audits against the checklist, produces a prioritized fix list, gets scope approval, and compares prior against revised before shipping.

## Case 3: Fix a description that never triggers

Date: [YYYY-MM-DD] | Harness: [name] | Model: [name]

| Prompt | Baseline behavior (observed) | With-skill behavior (observed) | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| My skill's description isn't triggering when people ask about receipts — improve it | | | |

Expected delta: baseline rewrites the description by intuition (often summarizing the workflow); with-skill builds and runs the trigger-query set, front-loads keywords, and treats the change as substantive (baseline gate or recorded waiver).

## Waiver (only when shipping without the comparison)

A substantive change must not ship without the comparison above or an
explicit waiver from the user, recorded here. Substantive means any change
to instruction semantics, the trigger description, or bundled resources.
Typo, formatting, and link-only fixes are exempt and need no waiver.

- Waived by the user: [yes — quote or paraphrase the user's explicit waiver]
- Reason: [why the comparison was skipped]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
